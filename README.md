# GAS_DETECTION_ALARM_SYSTEM_TINKERCAD
Abstract: The GAS DETECTION ALARM SYSTEM USING ADUINO aims in automatically detecting the gases and provides the alert to the users. The Gas Detection Alarm System is the process of detecting the hazardous gases or smokes by means of sensors. These sensors usually employ an audible alarm to alert the people when a dangerous gas has been detected. Here the Arduino Uno board are able to read the inputs - Signals of a sensor and turn it into an output - turning on an LED. The Gas sensor is detecting the gases or smoke when it is close (i. e) the concentration is greater than the specified threshold value. If any gases or smokes detected by the gas sensor, the buzzer alarm gets turned ON, the ALERT and EVACUATE displays in 16x2 LCD and the Red Led will glow. If the gases or smoke is away, it will displays SAFE and ALL CLEAR message in 16x2 LCD and the Green Led gets turned ON. This Gas Detection Alarm System using Arduino can be implemented at a large scale for various Gas industries, Municipal Gas distribution, Nuclear power stations. This system can be helpful in reducing the accidents caused by gas leakage in households for security purposes.
